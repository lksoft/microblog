			 <h1 id="using-icloud-key-value-store-across-apps">Using iCloud Key-Value Store Across Apps</h1>
<p>We wanted to use this for a couple of our macOS apps that are <strong>not</strong> distributed through the App Store. The first thing that I noted was that in the documentation for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsubiquitouskeyvaluestore"><code>NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore</code></a>, the last paragraph of the Overview says:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;To use this class, you must distribute your app through the App Store or Mac App Store&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I was instantly discouraged by this and so I started looking at the other iCloud functionality to see if it had the same limits. I didn&rsquo;t see anything in the documentation, nor in the search results that I found online. So I started to look at using that as a possibility. This seemed possible, but overly complicated for a couple of simple values that I wanted to make available. And again, online there were some implications that you needed to have at least one app in an App Store to be able to use the iCloud functionality, so I asked in a developer slack that I am a member of and got some uncertain replies about both iCloud in general and key-value specifically. So I decided to just write two apps and see what happens.</p>
<p>Turns out that it is pretty simple to do and works well enough. In fact, there even is documentation about it, but man was it not easy to find. So here is what you need to do and the links to documents that describe it.</p>
<p>So the first useful thing was a link to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/reference/supported-capabilities-macos/">supported capabilities for macOS</a> page that <a href="https://mjtsai.com">Michael Tsai</a> pointed me at, that said clearly that the key-value store <strong>is</strong> usable by an app distributed using a Developer ID! That is progress. I have raised a Feedback about the documentation issues (FB12199267), we&rsquo;ll see if it gets fixed.</p>
<p>The next step is to make sure that your app has the correct capabilities. I added the iCloud capability to the app and checked the  Key-value storage item in that section.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To use with multiple apps, you need to ensure that they are all using the same identifier for the key-value store. However, you cannot set that in the UI as you can for the CloudKit Containers. You&rsquo;ll need to open the entitlements file and edit it directly. Find the <code>iCloud Key-Value Store</code> item and adjust the value to be a common one that you use in all apps. In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012094-CH6-SW26">this document</a>, which I found later on (not when searching ‚Äì I actually can&rsquo;t remember where I clicked to get there), they give you details about how to do this (search for &ldquo;Multiple Apps&rdquo;) and they recommend using the id of the &ldquo;main&rdquo; app to share the info and then set that for all apps.</p>
<p>That can work, but I just designated a specific id (i.e. <code>com.littleknownsoftware.key-values.common</code>). You should just replace the part after the <code>$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)</code> though. I am not 100% sure if it would be a problem to remove it, but it seems like it would. Also you could try using a wildcard there (i.e. <code>com.littleknownsoftware.key-values.*</code>), but I don&rsquo;t know if that would work or not. It seems unlikely.</p>
<p>I had some issues with the provisioning and signing, but since these will vary for each setup, I am not going to go into that too much. If you normally just use the &ldquo;Automatically manage signing&rdquo;, hopefully it will work for you. If not then you need to be sure to manually create the Identifier for the app and the profile in your developer account online, like I did.</p>
<p>Using the Key-Value store is super easy after this stuff is all setup. In your <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching:</code> method, you can setup to receive notifications when things change like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>	func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ aNotification: Notification) {
		NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(storeDidChange), name: NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.didChangeExternallyNotification, object: NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.default)
		NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.default.synchronize()
	}
</code></pre><p>In a very simple case of displaying the values that are they, you will get those notifications in the method below and reload the tableView as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>	@objc
	func storeDidChange(_ note: Notification) {
		OperationQueue.main.addOperation {
			tableView.reloadData()
		}
	}

	//	MARK: TableView Delegation
	func numberOfRows(in tableView: NSTableView) -&gt; Int {
		return NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.default.dictionaryRepresentation.count
	}
	
	func tableView(_ tableView: NSTableView, objectValueFor tableColumn: NSTableColumn?, row: Int) -&gt; Any? {
		let dict = NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.default.dictionaryRepresentation
		guard row &lt; dict.count else {
			return nil
		}
		let key = dict.keys.sorted()[row]
		return [&quot;key&quot;: key, &quot;value&quot;: dict[key]]
	}
</code></pre><p>Note that the notification will come in on a background thread, so be sure to put your UI actions on the main thread so you don&rsquo;t crash!</p>
<p>To set values, simple call <code>NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.default.set(&quot;key&quot;, forKey: &quot;value&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>All your apps will have access to this data, as long as the user is logged into iCloud.</p>

			 <h3 id="dream-theater">Dream Theater</h3>
<p><strong>Concert Date:</strong> <em>29 January 2023</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong>Location:</strong> <em>Torwar, Warszawa</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since I was already in Warszawa for the weekend, I decided to go see the <strong>Dream Theater</strong> concert that would take place. It has been many years since I have seen them live and I haven&rsquo;t even paid much attention to their newest albums (<em>Dream Theater</em>, <em>Distance Over Time</em>, &amp; <em>A View From the Top of the World</em>), so I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what to expect. I have been a big fan before and even liked some of the music after Mike Portnoy left the band, but my interest has waned, even if I still enjoy the older stuff sometimes.</p>
<p>As usual, the musicians of <strong>Dream Theater</strong> are technically impressive when they play and this concert was no different. <strong>John Myung</strong> is always just an incredible bassist to watch. His fluidity with his instrument is mesmerizing and I love to watch him play. For me <strong>Dream Theater</strong> has always been a double-edged sword ‚Äì they are generally classified as <em>Prog Metal</em>, which is very apt and they could even credited with establishing that genre. There is metal music that I enjoy, but it is not why I come to music. I came to <strong>Dream Theater</strong> because of the prog esthetics <em>way</em> more than for any other reason.</p>
<p>This concert just reinforced for me why I have drifted away. This was a <em><strong>metal</strong></em> concert, through and through. The guest band, <strong>Arion</strong>, of whom I had never heard before, were straight up metal. Completely not my thing. And <strong>Dream Theater</strong> continued that trend in their part of the show. The two choices from early albums were <em>Pull Me Under</em> and <em>6:00</em>, which are both very heavy and never my favorites. The section that I enjoyed the most was the three last songs from <em>Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence</em>, which was fantastic!</p>
<p>Of course, they played a lot from their latest album <em>View From the Top of the World</em>, including the 20 min title piece, which was was interesting, but ultimately not my thing. This will probably be the last time that I see them, though I am glad that I went to see where they are at right now and where they are going. If you are into the more metal side of things, then I can definitely still recommend going to see this genre-defining group.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473581739">Less is More: How Degrowth Will Save the World</a> by Jason Hickel üìö</p>
<p>This book is fascinating in the way in breaks down the history of systemic/exploitative capitalism, how it came about 500 years ago, what the problems are with it and how to move beyond the problems that the current economic system has inflicted upon us.</p>
<p>I think for a lot of people this book may be hard to take because it really does go against the entire structure of our current global economy, but it is <strong>not</strong> a socialist manifesto or anything like that. In fact, it clearly shows that what would really be an <em>exchange-of-value</em> based economy is very different from what we currently have.</p>
<p>I would recommend it for anyone, but especially if you are at all concerned about the future of our environment and the inherent social/economic inequality in the world right now.</p>

			 <h3 id="distant-dream">Distant Dream</h3>
<p><strong>Concert Date:</strong> <em>28 January 2023</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong>Location:</strong> <em>Klub Potok, Warszawa</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After our hiking <a href="https://blog.scottjlittle.net/2023/01/29/hiking-in-the.html">trip in the mountains</a>, I stopped on the way from Krak√≥w to Gda≈Ñsk in Warszawa to see a couple of concerts and cheer on my fellow teammates in a Warszawa Liga Ultimate competition. On the Saturday night I went to see a band I had learned about in the last 6 months called <a href="https://distantdream.bandcamp.com"><strong>Distant Dream</strong></a>. They are actually from Gda≈Ñsk, though I have not yet seen or heard of any shows in the <em>trojmiasto</em>. Maybe in the near future. They play <em>post-rock/post-metal</em> as a genre, focused mostly on hard riffing guitars rather than using any keyboards.</p>
<p>Before I talk more about them, though there were 2 groups that played before them: <a href="https://walkamongstatues.bandcamp.com"><strong>Walk Among Statues</strong></a> first and then <a href="https://metafox.bandcamp.com"><strong>Metafox</strong></a>. All three bands are Polish, with <strong>Walk Among Statues</strong> being from Wroc≈Çaw and <strong>Metafox</strong> from Siedlce.</p>
<p><strong>Walk Among Statues</strong> were enjoyable live and enjoyed the bass playing quite a bit. The music was good without standing out for the <em>post-rock</em> genre. One thing that I found interesting about them is that they never really stopped between pieces. Maybe this is because they had a short amount of time and just tried to play through. Nothing at all problematic or unpleasant about it, but I thought it was interesting to note.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I had not know of <strong>Metafox</strong> before this concert, but I had taken the time to listen to their <em>Immobilize</em> album before the concert and found that I really enjoyed the diversity of the sounds that they put into the music. Although they were enjoyable on the stage and the bass player was obviously having a lit of fun dancing around in his socks, I didn&rsquo;t quite feel the diversity of sound that I did on the album. For instance, the lead guitarist did a lot of touch tapping, but you could only occasionally hear it well. Not a great disappointment, but too bad in any case. These guys had some great technical skill and reflected that it the instrument choices, both guitarists used 8 string guitars for their main axes and the bass guitar was a six string headless beast.</p>
<p>This band played to music that was the most listenable on stage for the evening, despite not being as diverse sounding as I hoped they would be. I would definitely see them again live.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I discovered <strong>Distant Dream</strong> via recommendations in Apple&rsquo;s Music app when I was listening to a bit of <strong>Tides From Nebula</strong>. Although they play in the same genre of music, they definitely do not have the same approach. As I mentioned, they rely heavily upon the guitars and creating a <strong>large</strong> wall of sound, using mostly the drums and bass to create some rhythm. Very head-bangy when live.</p>
<p>I love to listen to their studio albums and will keep doing so, but we&rsquo;ll see if I decide to go see them live again. But they do put on a great show and had a nice clean distraction-free stage, giving them space to move around freely and interact amonst each other.</p>

<p>However, as we approached the top of the hill, the fog cleared around us and we could see blue sky through the trees and the their tops covered in crystals were all brilliantly lit by the sun in white. It was <em>fantastic</em>. Then we came out of the forest to a clearing on the top and had a short little view ‚Äì which we had been missing the entire way. It was well worth the climb, even to the kids. There we found the shelter, <strong>Hala Kropowa</strong>, sitting just a bit down the other side of the crest.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We settled into the shelter, had lunch and took in the view from where we were, now that the clouds had mostly cleared off on the horizon. We had another wonderful surprise being able to see a mountain range off in the distance. It was probably the rest of the <strong>Beskids</strong>, but it could have been the <strong>Tatras</strong> as well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We seemed to be alone in the shelter for the night and we stayed up a little late playing <a href="https://www.playmonster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Farkle-Rules.pdf">Farkle (PDF)</a> with the kids, after a good Polish dinner along with a hot wine/beer or two. A nice finish to the day.</p>
<h2 id="day-four--jan-26">Day Four ‚Äì Jan 26</h2>
<p>The last day was supposed to be a day that wasn&rsquo;t too hard, even if it was long. We had 12kms to get from the shelter to the train station at <strong>Juszczyn</strong>, where we would take a train to <strong>Zembrzyce</strong> where we had a reservation in a little cabin. Most of that last day was downhill, but there were a couple of points where we had to go up and I know I certainly felt it. I was tired by this point. So were the kids.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course, the saving grace of the day was the incredible landscapes around us and the show on the trees. I enjoyed it immensely. We came to one little passage, where we had to go through a very narrow part, that felt like something from either a fairy tale or from <em>The Shining</em>!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The very last part before coming out in <strong>Juszczyn</strong> was quite steep going down and was in a little gully, that certainly looked like it would be a riverbed in springtime. It was very difficult from the view point of my knees üòñ. Boy was I happy when that flattened out and we were done with that part!</p>
<p>In summary, it was a very difficult trip and, as I told my wife, there actually were quite a few points (and maybe even overall) that I was not enjoying myself. But we had a plethora of beautiful sights, there were many moments where we were all having a good time together and we certainly pushed ourselves over the 4 days. My watched recorded (with extra walking parts here and there) 60km over the 4 days. That is quite a bit! My wife has started thinking about a trip at easter. We&rsquo;ll see Ch√©rie!</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780358651864">Grace: President Obama and Ten Days in the Battle for America</a> by Cody Keenan üìöI actually finished this book in mid-November, but I am just posting now. I also have to say that I might be a little biased, since Cody is my cousin, but this book was soooo good.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt read too much non-fiction usually, since I find it slow reading for me and I get a little impatient. This book was a great story though despite being non-fiction.</p>
<p>This tells the story of 10 days during the Obama administration with several significant events coming to a head. The story builds will many asides taking us back to significant events in the past that tie into the current story.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud and cried and chastised my cousin for being too hard on himself! But mostly, I just loved a great telling of meaningful events and people working to make the world.</p>

This book and its predecessor <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250197559">The Expert System&rsquo;s Brother</a> are great! I love the realistic aspect of how exploration on another planet is dealt with and not ignored as usual in SciFi.</p>
