			 <p>20 years ago last night, I met my better half. It has been a great adventure with her! I wish everyone such luck and love.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780358651864">Grace: President Obama and Ten Days in the Battle for America</a> by Cody Keenan 📚I actually finished this book in mid-November, but I am just posting now. I also have to say that I might be a little biased, since Cody is my cousin, but this book was soooo good.</p>
<p>I don’t read too much non-fiction usually, since I find it slow reading for me and I get a little impatient. This book was a great story though despite being non-fiction.</p>
<p>This tells the story of 10 days during the Obama administration with several significant events coming to a head. The story builds will many asides taking us back to significant events in the past that tie into the current story.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud and cried and chastised my cousin for being too hard on himself! But mostly, I just loved a great telling of meaningful events and people working to make the world.</p>

			 <p>Just finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250766380">The Expert System&rsquo;s Champion (The Expert System&rsquo;s Brother Book 2)</a> by Adrian Tchaikovsky 📚
This book and its predecessor <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250197559">The Expert System&rsquo;s Brother</a> are great! I love the realistic aspect of how exploration on another planet is dealt with and not ignored as usual in SciFi.</p>

			 <p>So it looks like I am going to start actually posting here on Mb. I have mostly been a lurker on twitter, but I want to change that since I have changed to be here. Content will probably be mostly around activities that I do, concerts, movies and maybe some ultimate frisbee as well.</p>
